            The following gif is really annoying, but it will keep going until you decide to allow us to use cookies or not.

            We want your cookies because we feel your pain and we'ld love you to never see this gif again. If you press "I agree" below, you allow us to remember that you've been here before and we thus won't show you the running cookie any longer. If you click "I
            don't agree", then that's fine, but you will have to stare at the cookie as many times as you visit this page again
